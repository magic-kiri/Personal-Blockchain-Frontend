# Personal-Blockchian-Frontend
This is the frontend portion of an academic project, Personal Blockchain, made with ReactJS.


## Introduction
The idea was to build a blockchain system running on the local network.
This web-app can be run in a local machine and store data in the blockchain as transactions. 
This will work only in a single LAN.


## Technologies
* ReactJS version: 17.0.2 
* HTML version: 5
* CSS version: 2.1
* MaterialUI version: 4.11.1


## Setup

1) To launc a React app, you don't need to install it. For further interest, visit [Getting Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
2) Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/arBishal/Personal-Blockchain-Frontend` command (for windows users) in the current directory.
3) In the project directory use `npm install @material-ui/core` command to install the *MaterialUI* dependecies.

## Launch
1) Open the directory where the project was cloned and run the web-app using `npm start`.
2) The app will run on [Localhost](localhost:3000) on port:3000.
3) To access all the features and have a better experience, implement the [Personal Blockchain Backend](https://github.com/magic-kiri/Personal-Blockchain-Backend) also.
